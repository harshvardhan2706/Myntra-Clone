# Myntra-Clone

A simple front-end clone of the Myntra homepage built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks).

## Project Overview

This repo contains a lightweight static mimic of Myntra's landing page layout. It demonstrates header/navigation, a hero banner, category/offer grids, and a footer.

## Live preview

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.

## Features

- Responsive-ish header with logo, nav links, search and action icons
- Hero banner and promotional grid using images in `images/offers`
- Category grid using images in `images/categories`
- Simple footer with columns

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (empty `script.js` placeholder)

## Project structure

- index.html — main page
- style.css — page styles
- script.js — placeholder for future interactivity (currently empty)
- images/ — contains `categories/`, `offers/`, logo and banner images

## How to run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Myntra-Clone
```

2. Open the page in your browser:

```bash
# Windows
start index.html
# macOS
open index.html
# Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

## Notes and next steps

- `script.js` is currently empty — add interactivity (search suggestions, cart/wishlist behaviors, navigation overlays).
- Consider adding responsiveness improvements (mobile layout, breakpoints).
- Add build/dev tooling if you plan to expand this into a larger project.
